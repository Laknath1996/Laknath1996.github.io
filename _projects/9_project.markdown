During this project, I developed machine learning and signal processing software to extract interpretable features from high-density multi-electrode array (MEA) signals acquired from in-vitro neuronal networks, and classify those networks according to the ion-channel mutations they contain. The project was advised by Prof. Steven Petrou and Prof. Saman Halgamuge.
