During this project, I developed software to determine the connectivity changes caused to the in-vitro neuronal networks by ion-channel mutations, via modeling the networks as time-varying graphs based on high-density MEA signals. The project was advised by Prof. Steven Petrou and Prof. Saman Halgamuge.
